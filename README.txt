My current goal for Cellars is to refine the forming of the Cellar logic and possible loosen the restraints. As well as to integrate a thermal shield check to provide passive cooling for burying the cellar.

 

This is a faithful recreation of the TFC Cellars Add-on for 1.7.10 by Sladki. All credit for primary logic goes to him.

 

The cellar structure provides a multi-block structure which will help preserve the food that you gather in TFC: TNG. The cellars support the cellar shelfs and signs, future block support is planned. However signs were a must so that users could label what they put in their shelves.

 

Each shelf can store up 14 slots of 64 items. They are meant for all TFC: TNG foods.

 

The ice bunker is the main brain of the structure, it requires either snow or ice to lower the internal temperatures of the structure but is not required. The bunker will gather information from TFC Ambiental to appropriately change the internal temperature, then apply changes based off if it has ice/snow. Ice and snow just provide different levels of coolant fuel for the bunker.

 

Two doors are not required, a second door will only make the structure more efficient.

The values used to determine how long the food will last at the three stages of cooling/freezing are configurable in the config.
